## Chapter 2 Day 2 Quests

Explain why we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script.

Well, it's because Jacob is a lot smarter and more capable than Andrea Muttoni.

What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?

What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?

This is the hardest quest so far, so if it takes you some time, do not worry! I can help you in the Discord if you have questions.

Add two new things inside your contract:

A variable named myNumber that has type Int (set it to 0 when the contract is deployed)
A function named updateMyNumber that takes in a new number named newNumber as a parameter that has type Int and updates myNumber to be newNumber
Add a script that reads myNumber from the contract

Add a transaction that takes in a parameter named myNewNumber and passes it into the updateMyNumber function. Verify that your number changed by running the script again.
